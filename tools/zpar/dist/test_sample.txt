             Inco Ltd., the Canadian nickel producer
being bought by  Brazil 's Cia. Vale do Rio, said third-quarter
profit soared 11-fold, boosted by surging metal prices and fees
paid by Falconbridge Ltd. after a failed takeover.  
 Net income jumped to $701 million, or $3.08 a share, from $64
million, or 29 cents, a year earlier, Toronto-based Inco said today
in a statement. Results included $109 million in net fees from the
failed deals with Falconbridge and Phelps Dodge Corp. Sales jumped
to $2.32 billion from $1.08 billion.  
 Inco sold nickel at double the price last year on average, and
output jumped 13 percent. Demand for the metal, used in stainless
steel, surged as global economic growth fueled demand, especially
in  China . Mines have failed to keep pace, prompting a buying spree
by producers seeking to bolster ore deposits. Vale outbid Phelps
Dodge and Teck Cominco Ltd. with its $17.3 billion bid.  
 ``Record quarterly earnings reflect the unprecedented
sustained strength we've seen in the nickel market, combined with
strong production,'' Inco Chief Executive Officer Scott Hand said
in the statement.  
 Shares of Inco gained 27 cents to C$85.85 at 4:10 p.m. on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. They have gained 80 percent in the past
year. Rio de Janeiro-based Vale, the world's largest iron-ore
producer, has offered C$86 a share for Inco.  
 Breakup Fees  
 Inco got $450 million from Falconbridge as a fee for their
failed merger, and made payments when deals failed with Phelps
Dodge and LionOre Mining International Ltd. A strike by workers at
Voisey's Bay in September led to a $24 million charge in the third
quarter, Inco said.  
 Phelps Dodge, the world's third-biggest copper producer, in
September dropped its offer of cash and stock for Inco, whose
shareholders supported an unsolicited cash bid from Vale.  
 Inco's nickel production climbed to 125 million pounds in the
quarter as prices jumped on average to $29,552 a metric ton. The
company had cut its output forecast from as much as 140 million
pounds because of strikes and equipment failures. Cash costs for
nickel sales fell 30 percent to $2.12 a pound, Inco said.  
 Inco is the world's second-biggest nickel producer by 2005
output behind  Russia 's OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel.  
 Copper output rose 1.7 percent to 27,669 metric tons and
prices jumped 90 percent on average to $7,465 a ton.  
 Nickel today reached the highest since at least 1987 as
supplies lag behind demand. Inventories monitored by the London
Metal Exchange plunged 86 percent this year. Mine output fell short
of demand by 70,000 metric tons in the eight months ended August,
the World Bureau of Metal Statistics said.  
 LME Nickel  
 Nickel for delivery in three months gained $375, or 1.2
percent, to $32,050 on the LME after reaching $32,625, the highest
in at least 19 years.  
 Extended repairs at operations in  Indonesia  and reduced output
at a smelter in Sudbury, Ontario, forced Inco to cut its original
production forecast for the quarter on Sept. 20.  
 Inco has restored full production at Sudbury and a unit in
Manitoba has returned to ``stable operations'' after a damaged
furnace hurt output, Inco said. The company had said Sept. 21 it
expected to return to full production at Manitoba by early October.  
 Inco declined to provide a forecast on earnings or production
before the expiration of the CVRD offer on Oct. 23.  
 Inco said it is ``continuing to review'' the cost and schedule
for the $2.15 billion Goro nickel project in New Caledonia that's
been slowed by a general strike in the country. Inco expects to
announce a ``revised cost estimate'' and schedule by the end of the
year.  
 ``There is a global shortage of skilled workers, which is felt
even more acutely in  New Caledonia  with its population of 230,000
people,'' said Jeff Zweig, deputy general manager at Goro, in an e-
mail on Oct. 16 ``To execute a project of this size and complexity,
a significant number of skilled workers are required.''
