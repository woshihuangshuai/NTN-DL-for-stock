How to Write a New Chapter of Document for ZPar

1. Create a "chaperXXX.in" file in zpar/doc/doc/.

2. Basically, a ".in" file is a partial HTML file.

3. IMPORTANT: the first line of a ".in" file must be a "Shabang line",
  which contains the title of the chapter. For example, for a chapter
  with title "This Is a New Chapter", the first line should be:
#!This Is a New Chapter
  Note there are NO spaces beforehead.

4. Use "<h2>" for section titles and do place an "<a id=...>" tag for
  cross reference, such as:
    <h2><a id="section-title">Section Title</a></h2>.

5. Use "<code></code>" for inline code and "<pre><code></code></pre>"
  for standalone block code.

6. Don't forget to add a link in "index.in" to your chapter if needed.

7. IMPORTANT: Do NOT hard code the "current version number" in ".in"
  files, use the "<RELEASEVER>" macro instead, which will be replaced
  by make doc.

8. When making new releases, change the "$RELEASEVER" in htmlfy.pl
